### Total Stall cycles:

As the fraction of Cache increases, the stall cycles gradually decrease. This might be because the active fraction increases, reducing the stall cycles caused by accesses, thus lowering the stall cycles.

As the fraction of Cache increases, the average bandwidth also decreases. This could be because a larger cache does not necessarily have a faster data transfer rate.

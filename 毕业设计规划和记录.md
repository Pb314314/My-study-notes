### Sound  and Raspberry Pi

描述：声音系统的目的是为了实现小车环境和司机的声音交互。目前，我们初步决定使用VOIP协议进行音频的传输。通过一个树莓派麦克风进行收音，使用USB接口连接。工作电压4.5V。一个树莓派音响进行放音，采用USBV供电，3.5MM音频接口。

The purpose of the sound system is to enable audio interaction between the car environment and the driver. Currently, we have decided to use the VOIP protocol for audio transmission. We will use a Raspberry Pi microphone, connected via a USB interface, for sound recording. It operates at a working voltage of 4.5V. For sound playback, we will use a Raspberry Pi speaker, powered via USB, with a 3.5mm audio jack.

具有一定的噪音控制能力。

收音设备能收集10dB以上的声音，达到两米及以上的有效距离，不会和音响产生干扰。

音响能清晰传递声音，让人能听清内容。

The microphone and speaker can be placed in a suitable location on the TurtleBots3, taking up a reasonable amount of space.

The sound system should enable stable remote connection between the car and the driver systems.

The system should have some degree of noise control capability.

The sound recording device should be able to collect sounds at 10dB or more, with an effective range of at least two meters, without interference from the speaker.

The speaker should be able to deliver clear sound that is easily heard and understood.



如何验证：

完成传输功能后进行收音检测，检测是否达到两米的收音范围。

检测收音的音量范围，看能否收音10dB以上的声音。

The sound recording function should have a delay of no more than 30ms after detection is complete, to meet requirements.

After completing the transmission function, sound recording should be tested to determine if the effective range of at least two meters is achieved.

The volume range of sound recording should be tested to determine if it can capture sounds at 10dB or higher.

The ability to transmit audio clearly in a noisy environment should be tested.

### Camera and Raspberry Pi

The information collected by the camera is the most important information for driving. We plan to use two Raspberry Pi cameras with a viewing angle of 220 degrees each to collect video information, and transmit it to the server using the UDP protocol.

### Driving Control system：

#### Steering control system

描述：

方向盘系统是用于反馈驾驶者做出的转向信号。我们目前计划制作有力反馈的方向盘控制系统来加强驾驶者的驾驶体验，同时真实的力反馈能更好模拟驾驶环境，降低驾驶的不适应性。

对于方向盘控制系统我们需要模拟现实的驾驶体验。力回馈需要准确地模拟真实的驾驶感受，包括方向盘的转向力度和车辆悬挂系统对方向盘的反馈。同时好的力回馈不应该有明显的抖动或突变，而应该平滑且连续。同时我们将保证反馈时间较低这样能实现更安全的控制。

我们需要自己完成驱动，让方向盘系统的信号能被Server识别，我们目前尝试使用pygame实现驱动的实现。具体实现细节还未确定。

要求:

实现大小合适的力反馈方向盘模拟，力反馈需要准确模拟真实的驾驶感受，提供准确的方向盘转向力度。

要求方向盘模拟器和Server之间延时在10ms以内，能低延时控制。

要求驱动能准确识别方向盘运动角度。



验证：

计算反馈电机的反馈力矩，需保证力矩在安全合理的范围。

测试Server驱动检测的信号延时，必须低于5ms。

检测驱动反馈的信号是否合理，能否真实反映驾驶者的动作。

Description:

The steering wheel system is used to provide feedback on the steering signals made by the driver. We are planning to develop a force feedback steering wheel control system to enhance the driver's driving experience, and to better simulate the driving environment and reduce the discomfort of driving.

For the steering wheel control system, we need to simulate the real driving experience. The force feedback needs to accurately simulate the real driving sensation, including the steering force of the steering wheel and the feedback from the vehicle suspension system to the steering wheel. At the same time, good force feedback should be smooth and continuous without noticeable jitter or sudden changes. We will also ensure low feedback latency to enable safer control.

We need to develop the driver ourselves to make the steering wheel system's signals recognizable by the server. We are currently attempting to use Pygame to implement the driver. Specific implementation details are yet to be determined.

Requirements:

Develop a suitably sized force feedback steering wheel simulator that accurately simulates the real driving experience and provides accurate steering wheel turning forces.

The latency between the steering wheel simulator and the server must be within 10ms and provide low latency control.

The driver must accurately recognize the steering wheel movement angle.

Validation:

Calculate the feedback torque of the feedback motor to ensure that the torque is within a safe and reasonable range.

Test the latency of the server driver detection signal, which must be less than 5ms.

Check whether the feedback signal is reasonable and can truly reflect the driver's actions.

#### Accelerator and Brake Pedal

描述：

脚踏板系统是传递车辆的油门和刹车信息。通过驾驶者对于脚踏板的按压程度进行处理。能向Server反馈驾驶者的操作。我们计划使用pygame实现驱动来获取脚踏板系统的控制信息。

要求：

能够准确反馈驾驶者的驾驶操作。

能较为真实模拟现实中的油门和刹车。

驱动能准确反馈将踏板系统的信号给Server。

验证：

计算驱动获取的脚踏板信号和人踩踏力度的大小关系是否合理。

测试Server驱动检测的信号延时，必须低于5ms。

Description:

The accelerator and brake pedal system is responsible for transmitting the throttle and brake information of the vehicle, which is processed by the driver's pressing degree. It can provide feedback to the server about the driver's operation. We plan to use Pygame to implement the driver to obtain control information from the pedal system.

Requirements:

- Able to accurately feedback the driver's driving operation.
- Can simulate the throttle and brake in real life to some extent.
- The driver can accurately feedback the pedal system signal to the server.

Validation:

- Calculate whether the relationship between the pedal signals obtained by the driver and the human stepping force is reasonable.
- Test the signal delay detected by the server driver, which must be less than 5ms.

# CS6422 : ExtraCreditAssignment

A) Extra Credit [2.5]

*What is the most surprising lesson regarding database systems that you've learned this semester?*

I think is the most surprising lesson is about the operator and the buffer manager. I think the great thing in databse is the pipeline. From bottom to top, all components working together to process the query and move the data between disk and memory. All these operations are hidder from the user. It is like a big performance, there are actors show on the stage and other people work behind the stage.



*What was your favorite topic and/or discussion this semester, and why?*

My favorite topic is the B+ tree because of its ingenious design. This data structure excels in efficiently accessing data and has the potential to offer effective solutions to multi-threading issues in databases. I am truly fascinated by how the complexity of this data structure elegantly addresses key pain points in database management.



*What was your least favorite topic and/or discussion this semester, and why?*

Maybe the least favorite topic is in the beginning of the semester. May be some concept in the database. Maybe how tuples are stored in the database. These concepts are a little boring. 



*Who was your favorite TA :)?*

I don't know the name of him. He is tall and very kind. He teach me how to use gdb and teach me about the buzzdb project. And answer my questions very patiently. 



*What was your favorite BuzzDB assignment, and why?*

I think I love the buffer management BuzzDB Assignment. Because I take long time to pass all the tests. I try hard to finish the multi-thread tests and the valgrind tests. I learn a lot in this project and I help my friends to finish the multi-thread  tests.



*What was your least favorite BuzzDB assignment, and why?*

I think all BuzzDB assignments are interesting. Maybe the B+ tree one is hard to debug? So I wrote a function to print the whole tree to debug. It was fun.



*Name one thing you would change in future offerings of BuzzDB assignments.*

Maybe add bonus for the B+ tree assignment about the multi-thread tests. To implement multi-thread in B+ tree can be challenge and helpful.



*What setbacks or unexpected joys did you encounter in your EvaDB projects?*

I don't know how to do EvaDB project. I think I learnt how to use EvaDB and add features to it. But just add some eazy features on the finished program. Maybe there can be more tutorial on how to add more challenge features on the EvaDB. I think I learnt more in BuzzDB projects.



*What did you learn in the process of working on EvaDB projects?*

I think work on a AI-database is very fun. I learn how database can work with AI models to conduct very great functions. 



B) "Extra" Extra Credit [2.5]

*Name one thing you would change in future offerings of this course.*

I feel that the presentation by EvaDB took too much time. It might be better to spend more time explaining database concepts because I don't gain much knowledge through the presentation. The assignment on BuzzDB is good, but I suggest considering combining several projects so that students can ultimately complete a simple database. Connecting the knowledge throughout the semester might be more beneficial for us to understand the relationships between database concepts and components.



*Suggest a thought-provoking short- or long-form question for exam 1.*

Given the page access sequence, let students make a choice regarding which replacement policy is more appropriate. This can help students gain a better understanding of the suitable scenarios for different buffer replacement policies.



*Suggest a thought-provoking short- or long-form question for exam 2.*

Why is the data in the leaf nodes of the B+ tree in Buzz DB stored in an array? What are the advantages of this approach? Why not use a vector?

What are the drawbacks of hashing compared to B+ trees? (prefix and multi-threading)

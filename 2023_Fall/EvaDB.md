# Project Documentation: SmartFeed.ai Integration

## Introduction

SmartFeed.ai can get the user input url and grasp content from website and feed the content into MindsDB and generate text to read. User can use this product to read the summary of the website.

## Current Project Details

**Backend Framework**: Express.js

**Web Scraping Library**: Cheerio

**Frontend Framework**: React

**Machine Learning Model**: MindsDB's GPT-4 via mindsdb-js-sdk

## Development Environment

**Programming Languages**: JavaScript, Node.js

**Development Tools**: Maybe MindsDB?

## Progress

The product and grab the content from url and generate the summary. I didn't really understand what I need to do. Do I need to use evadb instead of MindsDB to build a software? Or I need to add features to this current product? I will run the code locally and study the source code. 

## Testing

I will clone the github code and run locally. The code shoule be correct and I will try to understand the inner logic. I need to understand how it can efficiently do the AI job. And how this project utilized the MindsDB and ChatGPT tools. How it utilize the website content to generate text.

## Plans for Deployment

I will try to learn this software skills, because I don't have experience of software engineering. And I need to know the relationship between Evadb and this project.

## Conclusion

The SmartFeed.ai integration project is an exciting endeavor that harnesses the power of MindsDB's GPT-4 model for NLP tasks.

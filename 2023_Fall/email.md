Dear Professor Pan Li,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Bo Pang, and I am an enrolled student for the Fall 2023 intake of the MSECE program in GT. 

The purpose of this email is to express my interest in becoming a member of your research group, working on research related to machine learning and **graphs & networks**. Additionally, as I am planning to pursue the thesis option for my graduation requirements, I am writing to inquire if you would be willing to serve as my thesis advisor and research mentor.

Allow me to introduce myself. I completed my undergraduate studies in the **ECE program at Zhejiang University and UIUC**. I noticed that you also graduated from UIUC, which gives me a warm feeling. My undergraduate studies have provided me with a strong foundation in programming. Through courses such as UIUC's ECE220, ECE391, ECE385, and others, I gained a deep understanding of both software and hardware programming. I am also proficient in using debugging tools to complete projects. In the summer of 2022, I undertook a **research internship at NCSA at UIUC**, where I participated in projects related to NLP and psychology. This experience marked my first foray into machine learning projects, and it sparked my interest in the field. I greatly benefited from it and improved my communication skills.

I see that your research focuses on machine learning, especially in the realm of **graph & networks**, a field I have not explored before. However, I am confident in my ability to learn and am willing to invest the time required to delve into this new area. During my undergraduate studies, I self-studied CMU's 15-513 (Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective), which greatly enhanced my understanding of computer systems. Currently, I am self-studying CMU's 15-445 (Database Systems) this semester. This demonstrates my passion for computer knowledge and my strong aptitude for learning. While I lack prior research experience in graph neural networks, **I believe that it is never too late to start, and I have confidence in my capabilities**.

You mentioned **two qualities** that are highly important. I will outline my strengths and weaknesses in these areas.

Firstly, **Mathematical maturity**:

I am familiar with algorithms and have a reasonable understanding of **algorithms in machine learning**. I possess a great mathematical foundation, having systematically studied probability theory and calculus. My studies in calculus also included knowledge of linear algebra. Reading proofs in research papers during my previous work on federated learning has improved my ability to read papers and my mathematical skills. To be honest, I am not exceptionally strong in mathematical proofs, but I am willing to invest the time to learn more about proof methods.

Secondly, **Coding proficiency**:

I am highly **proficient in C++ programming** and have used it for numerous projects (In my CV). This semester, I am taking ECE6122 (C++ programming), ECE4180 (embedded systems), and CS6422 (database systems), all of which involve C++ programming. In the database course, I assisted many of my CS peers in building a multi-thread database buffer manager. This reflects my strong C++ programming skills. In my senior design project, I used C++ to implement a multi-threaded remote video transmission server. I possess a strong understanding of computer systems at a lower level, and next semester, I plan to take ECE6100 to learn deeper into low-level knowledge. Simultaneously, I am **skilled in scripting languages**. I have used Python to complete projects in UIUC's ECE428 (distributed systems) and ECE448 (Artificial Intelligence). I believe my coding skills can contribute to your team, and I can also achieve personal growth.

I would like to know when you might be available. If there's an opportunity, I'd like to have a face-to-face discussion with you. Since I'm not very familiar with the field of graph & networks, I wanted to ask if GT offers **any courses** related to your research that I could pursue in the future. I'm keen to engage in studying relevant papers and online courses.

I truly appreciate your careful review of my application and would be grateful to hear from you at your earliest
convenience. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Bo Pang

李攀教授您好，

我是庞博，

感谢您在百忙之中抽出时间，联系学生。您的学生可以通过slack或者wechat联系我。

我的slack账号是我的邮箱：bpang42@gatech.edu

我的wechat账号是：13305712108

我将开始学习图神经网络的相关知识。很感谢您推荐的课程。

如果能够加入您的团队，我很愿意在您或者学长进行谈话。关于我的时间节点。我希望知道，我大概在多久的时间内学习完成课程的内容，能参与进research。这样我能更好的安排自学的进度。

感谢您花时间读邮件，希望收到您的回复。感谢。

Dear Professor Li Pan,

I hope this email finds you well. I am Bo Pang, and I would like to express my gratitude for taking the time to reach out to students. I appreciate your efforts to connect with us.

I can contact on Slack and WeChat. My Slack account is linked to my email address: [bpang42@gatech.edu](mailto:bpang42@gatech.edu), and my WeChat ID is 13305712108. Your student can contact me use these easier ways. 

I am about to embark on a journey to study graph neural networks course. I am genuinely thankful for the course recommendations you've provided.

If there is an opportunity to join your research team, I would be very interested in discussing this further with you or any  students. Regarding the timeline, I also want to know how much time I have to acquire the necessary knowledge from the recommended courses before I could actively contribute to research. This information would greatly assist me in planning my self-study schedule more effectively.(我希望知道，我需要在多长时间内完成知识性学习。这样我能更好规划网课学习计划。)

Thank you for taking the time to read my email, and I look forward to receiving your response. Your guidance and insights would be highly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Bo Pang

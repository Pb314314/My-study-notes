# HW2 Report:

I run the code several times and the accuracy can reach 0.82. And the final accuracy is very related to inital random value.

For some initial state, the result can quickly reach 0.82 accuracy. But for some bad initialization, the result can't reach 0.8.

My prediction is largely smilar to the provided true clusters and can often reach 0.8 accuracy.
